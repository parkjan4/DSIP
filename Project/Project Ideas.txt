Idea #1: Doner Retention for Non-Profit Organizations

Problem Statement:
Can we predict whether or not a donor will unsubscribe (i.e. stop donating)?

Motivation:
This may seem like a trivial extension from customer retention problem in for-profit companies.
However, it isn't if you realize that donor retention is just as important to non-profits as customer retention is to for-profits.
In fact, one can argue that this is a more critical problem for non-profit organizations when you know that
1) data science and machine learning technologies are generally seen much less in non-profit organizations, and
2) vast majority of these organizations in fact rely on a small percentage of donors who give away big money;
therefore, they have a much smaller pool of donors to compete for.
